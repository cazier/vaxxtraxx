# vaxxtraxx
A collection of CLIs used to track whether it's time to renew your shots!


## Idea
The intent of this repository is to try to create the same library to test determine whether you need to make an appointment at your local pharmacy to get an updated vaccine. Each language should provide a command-line interface (CLI) that can be supplied vaccine information, and will output what you should schedule, and optionally, what's coming up.

## Python
The [Python](./python) directory has some (mostly) blank files that need to be filled in with actual code.

# Tests
Each language should also include a comprehensive testsuite to verify that each function works properly and captures the appropriate errors.
